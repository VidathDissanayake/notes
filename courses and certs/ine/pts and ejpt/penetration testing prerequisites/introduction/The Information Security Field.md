## Infosec Culture

Information Security has deep roots in the underground hacking scene. 

The term "hacker" was born in the 1960s in MIT. It refers to people who try to understand how a computer system works, find new ways to use and break them rather than just using it. These people are usually very curious, intelligent, and motivated to pursue knowledge.

Hackers and infosec professionals seek to use computer systems, bypassing restrictions imposed by vendors and programmers to find security any security issues in the system. To perform an attack on a system, you need to have a deep understanding of how it works.

There is always something new to learn in the vast field of information security. Hackers explore and improve their skills daily. Hackers are curious and hungry for knowledge.

Hacking is not only related to computers. It's a lifestyle applied to even [telephone lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Draper) and [people](https://www.mitnicksecurity.com/about/kevin-mitnick-worlds-most-famous-hacker-biography).

[The Conscience of a Hacker](http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html), also known as The Hacker's Manifesto written by The Mentor, gives an idea about the ideals of the underground hacking community. 

Being an infosec professional means pursuing knowledge, being honest and never stop challenging yourself and colleagues. 

## Career Opportunities

Companies and governments are using technology to store, process confidential data on computers and mobile devices and transfer that data over public and private networks. Companies must protect this sensitive data, and they pay (or should pay) a premium to safeguard this data.

Recently, governments have had to face a broad range of cyber threats including global cyber syndicates, hackers for hire, hacktivists, terrorists, and state sponsored hackers. With national security at risk and critical infrastructure like power plants and railways controlled by computers, ethical hackers are needed to protect them.

Companies and governments need to set up software and hardware defences. They also need to train their organization to make sure that secure applications are developed, proper defensive measure are taken and proper use of company data are in place.

To test these defences, a penetration tester should be hired. Penetration testers, also called pentesters, are professionals hired to simulate a hacking attack against a network, a computer system, a web application or the entire organization. They master the same tools that malicious hackers use to find any and all vulnerabilities present in the system. They work as freelancers, in an IT security company or as in-house employees. Furthermore, they can also be specialists in,
- System attacks
- Web applications
- Malware analysis
- Reverse engineering
- Mobile applications and more.

The demand for penetration testers is on a steady growth. To have a successful pentesting career, you need to be passionate, skilled, and hungry for knowledge.
