FoxyProxy is an browser extension that allows us to save proxy profiles, meaning we can quickly and easily switch our proxy profiles in a matter of clicks, then disable the proxy just as easily.

There are two versions of FoxyProxy: 
- Basic
- Standard


## FoxyProxy Basic


## FoxyProxy Standard

FoxyProxy Standard gives you a lot more control over what traffic gets sent through the proxy. 

For example, it will allow you to set pattern matching rules to determine whether a request should be proxied or not.
