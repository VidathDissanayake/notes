# Burp Suite Repeater

> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

Repeater is a [Burp Suite](../../Burp%20Suite.md) [module](../modules.md) that allows us to craft and/or relay intercepted requests to a target at will.

It also provides a [GUI](Repeater%20interface.md) for writing the request [payload](../../../../../../network/communication%20protocol/structure%20of%20a%20protocol/payload.md) and numerous [Repeater views](Repeater%20views.md) (including a rendering engine for a graphical view) of the response.
