There are three different editions of [Burp Suite](Burp%20Suite.md) available.

1. **Burp Suite Community** edition
2. **Burp Suite Professional** edition
3. **Burp Suite Enterprise** edition

## Burp Suite Community Edition

[Burp Suite](Burp%20Suite.md) community edition is **free to use for any legal, non-commercial** purposes.

Has a **subset of Professional edition** features. 

Whilst Burp Community has a relatively limited feature-set compared to the Professional edition, it still has many superb [modules](modules/modules.md) available.

For this reason, this is the commonly used edition.


## Burp Suite Professional Edition

[Burp Suite](Burp%20Suite.md) professional edition requires an expensive licence. (₤319/$399 per year per person!)

**Unrestricted version of Community edition.**

**Features:**
- An automated vulnerability scanner.
- A fuzzer/bruteforcer that isn't rate limited.
- Saving projects for future use; report generation.
- A built-in API to allow integration with other [tools](../../../tools.md).
- Unrestricted access to add new [Burp extensions](modules/Extender/Burp%20extensions.md) for greater functionality.
- Access to the [Burp Suite](Burp%20Suite.md) Collaborator (effectively providing a unique request catcher self-hosted or running on a Portswigger owned server).

In short, Burp Pro is an _extremely_ powerful tool.


## Burp Suite Enterprise Edition

Slightly different from other two editions.

Used for continuous scanning.

It provides an automated scanner that can periodically scan web apps for vulnerabilities in much the same way as software like Nessus performs automated infrastructure scanning.

Sits on a server and constantly scans target web apps for vulnerabilities.
