Burp Suite is the industry standard tool for web application hacking, and is essential in any web penetration test.

Burp Suite is a framework written in Java.

It aims to provide a one-stop-shop for web application penetration testing.

Burp Suite is also very commonly used when assessing mobile applications because it can be used for testing the APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) powering most mobile apps.

***The core of the framework:*** Capture and manipulate all of the traffic between an attacker and a webserver.

This captured traffic can be forwarded to other parts of the framework for further manipulation.

This ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests prior to them being sent to the target server (or, in some cases, the responses before they are received by our browser), makes Burp Suite perfect for any kind of manual web app testing.

There are different [editions](editions.md) of Burp Suite.
