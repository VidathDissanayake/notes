# Burp Suite Repeater

Repeater is a [Burp Suite](../../Burp%20Suite.md) [module](../modules.md) that allows us to craft and/or relay intercepted requests to a target at will.

It also provides a [GUI](interface.md) for writing the request payload and numerous [views](views.md) (including a rendering engine for a graphical view) of the response.
