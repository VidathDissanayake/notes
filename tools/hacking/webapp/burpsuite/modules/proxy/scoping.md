# Scoping

If [Burp Suite](../../Burp%20Suite.md) is capturing all traffic that goes through the [Proxy](Proxy.md), things can get cluttered.

The solution to this is scoping.


## Disabling Logging of Out of Scope Targets

Setting a scope for the project allows us to define what gets proxied and logged. We can restrict [Burp Suite](../../Burp%20Suite.md) to only target the web application(s) that we want to test.

The easiest way to do this is by switching over to the [Target](../target/Target.md) tab, right-clicking our target from our list on the sitemap, then choosing "Add To Scope". 

Burp will then ask us whether we want to stop logging anything which isn't in scope -- most of the time we want to choose "yes" here.


## Disabling Intercept of Out of Scope Targets

Even though we disabled logging, that doesn't stop Burp [Proxy](Proxy.md) from [intercepting](Proxy.md#Intercept) out of scope traffic. 

To turn this off, we need to go into the [Options](Proxy.md#Options) sub-tab in [Proxy](Proxy.md) and select "`And URL Is in target scope`" from the Intercept Client Requests section:
