# Navigation in Burp Suite

Navigating around the [Burp Suite](Burp%20Suite.md) GUI by default is done entirely using the top menu bars:

![tabs](assets/tabs.png)

These allow to switch between [modules](modules.md). 

These tabs can also be detached into separate windows. This can be done by clicking "Window" in the application menu at the top of the screen, then choosing to "Detach" tabs:

![detach windows](assets/detach%20windows.png)

These can be reattached in the same way or by closing the detached window.

Sub-tabs of modules can be selected from the second menu bar that will appear below the first one. These usually provide module specific settings.

In addition to the menu bar, Burp Suite also has keyboard shortcuts that allow quick navigation to key tabs. By default, these are:

|	**Shortcut**   |    		**Does**	   |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| `Ctrl + Shift + D` | Switch to the Dashboard	 |
| `Ctrl + Shift + T` | Switch to the Target tab	 |
| `Ctrl + Shift + P` | Switch to the Proxy tab	 |
| `Ctrl + Shift + I` | Switch to the Intruder tab|
| `Ctrl + Shift + R` | Switch to the Repeater tab|
