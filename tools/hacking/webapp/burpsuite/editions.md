# Editions

There are three different editions of [[Burp Suite]] available.

1. **Burp Suite Community** edition
2. **Burp Suite Professional** edition
3. **Burp Suite Enterprise** edition

## Burp Suite Community Edition

Burp Suite community edition is **free to use for any legal non-commercial** purposes.

Has a **subset of Professional edition** features. 

Whilst Burp Community has a relatively limited feature-set compared to the Professional edition, it still has many superb [[modules]] available.

For this reason, this is the commonly used edition.


## Burp Suite Professional Edition

Burp Suite professional edition requires an expensive licence. (₤319/$399 per year per person!)

**Unrestricted version of Community edition.**

**Features:**
- An automated vulnerability scanner.
- A fuzzer/bruteforcer that isn't rate limited.
- Saving projects for future use; report generation.
- A built-in API to allow integration with other tools.
- Unrestricted access to add new [[extensions]] for greater functionality.
- Access to the Burp Suite Collaborator (effectively providing a unique request catcher self-hosted or running on a Portswigger owned server).

In short, Burp Pro is an *extremely* powerful tool.


## Burpsuite Enterprise Edition

Slightly different from other two editions.

Used for continuous scanning.

It provides an automated scanner that can periodically scan webapps for vulnerabilities in much the same way as software like Nessus performs  automated infrastructure scanning.

Sits on a server and constantly scans target web apps for vulnerabilities.
