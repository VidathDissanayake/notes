Tools in the [[Burp Suite]] framework 

- **Proxy:** [[Proxy]] allows us to intercept and modify requests/responses when interacting with web applications.
- **Repeater:** [[Repeater]] allows us to capture, modify, then resend the same request numerous times.
- **Intruder:** [[Intruder]] allows us to spray an endpoint with requests. Used for [[bruteforcing]] and [[fuzzing]].
- **Decoder:** [[Decoder]] provides the ability to transforming data. Either in terms of [[decoding]] captured information, or [[encoding]] a payload prior to sending it to the target.
- **Comparer:** [[Comparer]] allows us to compare two pieces of data at either word or byte level.
- **Sequencer:** [[Sequencer]] is used for assessing the randomness of tokens such as session cookie values or other supposedly random generated data.
- **Extender:** [[Extender]] allows quickly and easily load extensions into the framework, as well as providing a marketplace to download third-party modules (referred to as the "BApp Store").
