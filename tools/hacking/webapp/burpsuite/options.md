# Options for Configuring Burp Suite

There are two main types of options in [[Burp Suite]].
- Global settings (User options tab).
- Project-specific settings (Project options tab)

## User Options

User options apply every time Burp is opened.

The settings here apply globally. They control the application. However, most of them **can be overwritten** by [[#Project Options]].

There are four main sub-sections of the User options tab:
- **Connections** allow us to control how Burp makes connections to targets. (Eg: Through a proxy.)
- **TLS** allows us to enable and disable various TLS options.We can also upload client certificates there if needed.
- **Display** allows us to change how Burp Suite looks. (E.g. Font, scale, dark mode.) Also allows to configure things like the rendering engine in [[Repeater]].
- **Misc** contains settings including the keybindings table (HotKeys).
