# Options for Configuring Burp Suite

There are two main types of options in [[Burp Suite]].
- Global settings (**User options** tab).
- Project-specific settings (**Project options** tab)

## User Options

User options apply every time Burp is opened.

The settings here apply globally. They control the application. However, most of them **can be overwritten** by [[#Project Options]].
