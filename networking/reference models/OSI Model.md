# OSI Model

The OSI Model or the Open Systems Interconnect Model is one of the most famous network reference models.

It is made up of 7 layers. These layers have different names, and the information passing through different layers are referred to using different names.

| Layer | Name | Information Name |
|-------|------|------------------|

It is important to understand that every protocol doesn't fit neatly into a single layer. This is not the reality. There are protocols that work over multiple layers. **This is a reference model, not a reverence model!**

## Physical Layer

This layer is concerned with getting bits on the wire. This is the physical hardware components such as copper wires and fibre optic cables.


## Data Link Layer

## Network Layer

## Transport Layer

## Session Layer

## Presentation Layer

## Application Layer
