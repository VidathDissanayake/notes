# OSI Model

The OSI Model or the Open Systems Interconnect Model is one of the most famous network reference models.

It is made up of 7 layers. These layers have different names, and the information passing through different layers are referred to using different names.

| Layer |                   Name                      | Information Name |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|
|   1   | [Physical Layer](#Physical%20Layer)         | Bits             |
|   2   | [Data Link Layer](#Data%20Link%20Layer)     | Frames           |
|   3   | [Network Layer](#Network%20Layer)           | Packets          |
|   4   | [Transport Layer](#Transport%20Layer)       | |
|   5   | [Session Layer](#Session%20Layer)           | |
|   6   | [Presentation Layer](#Presentation%20Layer) | Data             |
|   7   | [Application Layer](#Application%20Layer)   | Data             |

It is important to understand that every protocol doesn't fit neatly into a single layer. This is not the reality. There are protocols that work over multiple layers. **This is a reference model, not a reverence model!**

## Physical Layer

This layer is concerned with getting bits on the wire. This is the physical hardware components such as copper wires and fibre optic cables.


## Data Link Layer

## Network Layer

## Transport Layer

## Session Layer

## Presentation Layer

## Application Layer
