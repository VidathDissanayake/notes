## History of the Internet

### The ARPNET

The first iteration of the Internet was within the **ARPANET** project in the late *1960s*.

This project was funded by the **United States Defence Department**.

It is also the **first documented network** in action.


### The Internet and the World Wide Web

The Internet as we know it was invented in *1989* by **Tim Berners-Lee** by the creation of the **World Wide Web (WWW)**.

Until then, the Internet wasn't used as a **repository for storing and sharing information** as it is being used now.
