# IP Addressing

An **Internet Protocol (IP) address** can be used as a way of identifying a host on a network **for a period of time**.

Then that IP address can then be associated with another device without the IP address changing.
- IPv4 addresses
- IPv6 addresses

## IPv4 Addresses

***Note: For this section, I will be refering to IPv4 addresses as simply IP addresses. Generally, an "IP address" is an IPv4 address unless specified as IPv6.***

An IP address is a **32 bit** number that is divided into four octets of **8 bits each**.

This number is calculated through a technique known as **IP addressing & subnetting**.

IP addresses can change from device to device but **cannot be active simultaneously more than once within the same network**.
