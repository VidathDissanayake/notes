# MAC Addresses

All **network interface cards (NICs)** have a unique **12 character 48 bit hexadecimal number** address hardcoded in it.

These 12 characters are separated into **6 groups of 2** with **colons (:)** as separators.

This address is known as the **Media Access Control (MAC)** address.

A MAC address is composed of **2 main sections**.
1. Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)
    - The **1st 24 bits (6 characters or 3 parts)** represent the **company** that made the network interface.
    - This is known as the **Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)**
2. Device ID
    - The remaining part is the **Device ID**. This is **unique to your NIC**.
