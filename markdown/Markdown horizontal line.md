# Horizontal Lines

> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more `asterisks` (`***`), `dashes` (`---`), or `underscores` (`___`) on a line by themselves.

For compatibility, put blank lines before and after horizontal rules.

**Syntax:**

```md
---

***

___
```

**Output:**

---

***

___
