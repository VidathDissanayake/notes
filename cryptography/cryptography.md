Cryptography is using mathematical algorithms to encrypt data to protect data.

Cryptographic algorithms are publicly known. It is important to use public algorithms and not proprietary algorithms. This is because public algorithms are peer-reviewed by hundreds of people over many years and proven hard to crack.

## Usage

Cryptography is used to protect data. There are many instances of cryptography being used. 

For example:
- [Secure communication](secure%20communication/secure%20communication.md):
    - [web traffic](secure%20communication/web%20traffic.md): [TLS](secure%20communication/secure%20communication%20protocols/TLS.md)(HTTPS)
    - wireless traffic: 802.11i WPA2(WiFi), GSM(Cell phone), Bluetooth
- Encrypting files on a disk:
    - EFS, TrueCrypt
- Content protection: CSS(DVD), AACS(Blu-ray)

There are 3 steps in cryptography.
1. Precisely specify threat model.
2. Propose a construction.
3. Prove that breaking the construction under threat model will solve an underlying hard problem.
