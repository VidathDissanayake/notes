# Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher is not technically a cipher, as it has no key. Instead, each character is shifted by 3.

So a=d, b=e, c=f, x=a, y=b, z=c and so on.

## Breaking Caesar Cipher

This is essentially a substitution cipher where the key is fixed. Therefore, it is easy to find the message if it is known that the encryption is done using Caesar Cipher, as the key isn't secret.
