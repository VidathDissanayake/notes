Caesar Cipher is not technically a cipher, as it has no key. Instead, each character is shifted by 3.

So a=d, b=e, c=f, x=a, y=b, z=c and so on.

This is essentially a [Substitution Cipher](Substitution%20Cipher.md) where the key is fixed. Therefore, it is easy to find the message if it is known that the encryption is done using Caesar Cipher, as the key isn't secret.
