# Virtual Private Network (VPN)

> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

A VPN uses cryptography to extend a [private network](../../../network/types%20of%20networks/private%20network.md) over a [public network](../../../network/types%20of%20networks/public%20network.md) like [the internet](../../../network/the%20internet.md). This is done by making a protected connection to a private network, such as an office or home network. To a client, connecting via a VPN will be the same as connecting directly to the private network.
