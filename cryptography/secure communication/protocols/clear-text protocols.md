# Clear-text Protocols

> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

Clear-text protocols transmit data over the network without any encryption. This allows an attacker to eavesdrop on the conversation and perform malicious actions such as intercept, eavesdrop and mangle with ease.

Use of these protocols should be minimized whenever possible. They should never be used to transmit critical or private information. If there is aboslutely no other alternative, they should only be used in trusted networks.
