# Clear-text Protocols

> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

Clear-text protocols transmit data over the network without any encryption. This allows an attacker to eavesdrop on the conversation and perform malicious actions with ease.

Use of these protocols should be minimized whenever possible. They should never be used to transmit critical or private information.
