# Zero Knowledge

> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

Zero knowledge or zero knowledge proof of knowledge is when a party proves to another party that it has knowledge of something without letting the other party know what that something is.

For example, a party will prove that it knows the factors used to create a number N to a party that only knows the number N without telling them what the factors actually are.
