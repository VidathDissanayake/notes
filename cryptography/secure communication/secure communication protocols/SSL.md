SSL is the predecessor of [TLS](TLS.md)

Netscape developed the original SSL protocols, and Taher Elgamal, chief scientist at Netscape Communications from 1995 to 1998, has been described as the "Father of SSL".

SSL had 3 versions.

|Protocol| Published |Deprecated|
|:------:|:---------:|:--------:|
|SSL 1.0 |Unpublished|          |
|SSL 2.0 |   1995    |   2011   |
|SSL 3.0 |   1996    |   2015   |

SSL is no longer in use, as it has severe security flaws.
