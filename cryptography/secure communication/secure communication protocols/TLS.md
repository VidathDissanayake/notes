TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the successor to [SSL](SSL.md). However, [SSL](SSL.md) is widely known, so [SSL](SSL.md) is used to refer to TLS too.

These are slightly different protocols. TLS is essentially an improved version of SSL.

TLS has 4 versions that have been released as of the time of writing.

|Protocol|Published|Deprecated|
|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|
|TLS 1.0 |  1999   |   2020   |
|TLS 1.1 |  2006   |   2020   |
|TLS 1.2 |  2008   |          |
|TLS 1.3 |  2018   |          |

TLS has 2 parts.
1. Handshake Protocol – Establish shared secret key using public key [cryptography](../../cryptography.md).
2. Record Layer – Transmit data using shared secret key. Ensures [confidentiality](../../../hacking/principles%20and%20standards%20of%20infosec/CIA%20triad/confidentiality.md) and [integrity](../../../hacking/principles%20and%20standards%20of%20infosec/CIA%20triad/integrity.md).
