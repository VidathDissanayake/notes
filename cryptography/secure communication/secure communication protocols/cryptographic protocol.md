Cryptographic protocols encrypt the information being transmitted to protect the communication.

A main goal of cryptographic protocols is to prevent eavesdropping. Thanks to the encryption, even if an attacker intercepts the traffic, they won't be able to understand it.

Cryptographic protocols should always be used when transmitting private and sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords.
