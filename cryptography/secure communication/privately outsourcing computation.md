Privately outsourcing computation is when you send encrypted data to be processes to another party, they will do processing on the encrypted data without knowing what the actual data is and will return encrypted results.

For example, we send an encrypted query to Google, they process it and return encrypted results. When this happens, Google will not know what the search was about but we will get the results that we are looking for.
