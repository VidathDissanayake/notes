IP runs on the [Internet Layer](../../../../reference%20models/layers/Internet%20Layer.md) of the [TCP/IP Model](../../../../reference%20models/TCP%20IP%20Model/TCP%20IP%20Model.md) and the [Network Layer](../../../../reference%20models/layers/Network%20Layer.md) of the [OSI Model](../../../../reference%20models/OSI%20Model/OSI%20Model.md). It is in charge of delivering IP packets to hosts involved in communication, and it uses [IP address](IP%20address.md)es to identify hosts.

IP uses [encapsulation](../../../../reference%20models/encapsulation.md) to carry upper layer protocols such as [TCP](../../../TCP%20IP%20layer%203/OSI%20layer%204/TCP.md) and [UDP](../../../TCP%20IP%20layer%203/OSI%20layer%204/UDP.md).
