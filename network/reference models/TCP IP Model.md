# TCP/IP Model

> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

When the [OSI Model](OSI%20Model.md) was originally developed, it was not clear that we will be primarily running protocols of the TCP/IP suite. There were other contenders besides having [IP addresses](../protocols/layer%203/IP/IP%20address.md) in our devices. However, now it is clear that we are in a [IP](../protocols/layer%203/IP/IP.md) based world, so TCP/IP model might be more suitable.

The TCP/IP Model is also called the Department of Defence (DOD) Model.

Commonly, this model combines the first 2 layers of the [OSI Model](OSI%20Model.md) into one layer and the last 3 layers of the [OSI Model](OSI%20Model.md) into another layer.

There are variations of this model with different layer names and different number of layers.
