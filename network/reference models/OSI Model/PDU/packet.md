# Packet

> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

Packets are technically the [PDU](PDU.md) of the [Network Layer](../../layers/Network%20Layer.md) of the [OSI Model](../OSI%20Model.md).

However, even though technically incorrect, the term packet is colloquially used to refer to any chunk of [data](data.md) being transmitted through a [network](../../../network.md).
