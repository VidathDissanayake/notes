# Bit

> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

Bit stands for **B**inary Dig**it**. It is used to refer to a single digit in [binary](../../../../../general/encoding%20and%20decoding/binary/binary.md). This is the [PDU](PDU.md) of the [Physical Layer](../../layers/Physical%20Layer.md) of the [OSI Model](../OSI%20Model.md).

Bits are nothing more than electric signals running through a medium. The presence of electricity represents a [binary](../../../../../general/encoding%20and%20decoding/binary/binary.md) 1 and the absence of it represents a [binary](../../../../../general/encoding%20and%20decoding/binary/binary.md) 0. Bits can travel through many media in many forms, not just electricity.
