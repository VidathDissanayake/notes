# Transport Layer

> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

This layer is concerned with [network](../../../network.md) connections. There are 2 basic types of connections.

- Connection Oriented (Reliable) Connections
- Connection Less (Unreliable) Connections

Transmission Control Protocol ([TCP](../../../communication%20protocol/layer%204/TCP.md)) is a reliable connection protocol and User Datagram Protocol ([UDP](../../../communication%20protocol/layer%204/UDP.md)) is an unreliable connection protocol used in this layer.
