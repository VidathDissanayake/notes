> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

[Network](../network.md) reference models are models that are used to provide a frame of reference for how a device or a protocol is going to interact with another.

The two most famous reference models are the [OSI Model](OSI%20Model.md) (**O**pen **S**ystems **I**nterconnect Model) and the [TCP/IP Model](TCP%20IP%20Model.md).
