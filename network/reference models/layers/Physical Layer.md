> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

This layer is concerned with getting bits on the wire. This is the physical hardware components such as copper wires and fibre optic cables.

[Bits](../OSI%20Model/PDU/bit.md) in the physical layer can travel in many media in many forms.

E.g:
- As electricity though coper wires.
- As light through fibre optic cables.
- As radio waves through air in [Wi-Fi](../../communication%20protocol/TCP%20IP%20layer%201/Wi-Fi.md).
