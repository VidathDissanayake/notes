## Text Formatting

- To make text italic, surround the text with `*` or `_`.
- To make text bold, surround the text with `**` or `__`.
- To strikethough text, surround the text with `~~`.
- To put text in a blockquote, prepend with `>` and a `space`. Can be nested by adding more `>` s. 
- `Two spaces` at the end of the line before pressing `enter` will cause a line break.
- `\` at the end of line will also cause line breaks. (**May not be available in every application.**)
- To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text. Do not add indentation infront of paragraphs unless they are in a list to avoid unexpected formatting problems.

**Syntax:**

```markdown
*text* or _text_

**text** or __text__

~~text~~

> text
