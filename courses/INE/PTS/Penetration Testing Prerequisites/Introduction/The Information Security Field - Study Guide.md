Companies and governments are using technology to store, process confidential data on computers and mobile devices and transfer that data over public and private networks. Companies must protect this sensitive data, and they pay (or should pay) a premium to safeguard this data.

Recently, governments have had to face a broad range of cyber threats including global cyber syndicates, hackers for hire, hacktivists, terrorists, and state sponsored hackers. With national security at risk and critical infrastructure like power plants and railways controlled by computers, ethical hackers are needed to protect them.

Companies and governments need to set up software and hardware defences. They also need to train their organization to make sure that secure applications are developed, proper defensive measure are taken and proper use of company data are in place.

To test these defences, a penetration tester should be hired. Penetration testers, also called pentesters, are professionals hired to simulate a hacking attack against a [network](../../../../../network/network.md), a computer system, a web application or the entire organization. They master the same [tools](../../../../../tools/tools.md) that malicious hackers use to find any and all vulnerabilities present in the system. They work as freelancers, in an IT security company or as in-house employees. Furthermore, they can also be specialists in,
- System attacks
- Web applications
- Malware analysis
- [Reverse engineering](../../../../../reverse%20engineering/reverse%20engineering.md)
- Mobile applications and more.

The demand for penetration testers is on a steady growth. To have a successful pentesting career, you need to be passionate, skilled, and hungry for knowledge.

A user is someone who uses the computer system. It can be an employee of the client or an external user. A malicious user is someone who misuses or attacks the computer system and applications.

The root or Administrator users have high privileges and manage the [network](../../../../../network/network.md) or system. Privileges are the actions that the user is allowed to do. The higher the privileges, the more control the user has over the system.

Security through obscurity is the use of secrecy of design, implementation, and configuration to provide security. However, this cannot stop a skilled and motivated attacker.

An attack is any kind of action aimed at misuse or taking control over a computer system or an application. Some examples of attacks are,
- Getting unauthorized access to an admin area.
- Stealing user passwords.
- Causing denial of service.
- Eavesdropping on communications.
