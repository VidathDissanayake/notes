## Introduction and Information

Asanka Amarasinghe is graduate of University of Moratuwa with a B.Sc. Engineering (Hon's) in Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering. 

This course will,
- Bridge the gap between G.C.E. A/L and University.
- Cover the academic content of the first year.
- Also cover some parts beyond the first year that are useful to understand 1st year content.

There are two semesters (~4 months each) in the first year and the June Term (~2 months). Usually special courses are taught in the June Term. In Moratuwa University, field selection is done after the first semester. In all others, after the first year.

During this time, common subjects will be taught.

University of Moratuwa - Semester 1: 
- Mathematics - 3C
- Programming Fundamentals - 3C
- Mechanics - 2C
- Properties of Materials - 2C
- Fluid Mechanics - 2C
- Electrical Engineering - 2C

Here C stands for Credits. In general, this represents the time spent for this (1C = ~15h) and also for exams 3C ~ 3h exam. Also the effect of 3C subjects are more influential for Grade Point Average (GPA). 

When calculating the GPA, a different amount of points is given to different grades (4 points to A). This means you get 4 points whether you get 75 marks or 100 marks. However, if you are just short of a grade (A-) you loose a lot in GPA (3.7).
