## Terminology

## Definition

An equation containing differential coefficients is known as a differential equation (DE).

## Formation of Differential Equations

Differential equations are obtained by differentiating ordinary equations and eliminating arbitrary constants.

## Properties of Differential Equations

### Order



### Degree

## Solving Differential Equations

The process of obtaining an equation without containing derivatives from a DE is known as solving the DE. The obtained ordinary equation is known as the solution of the differential equation.

The method of obtaining the solution is an integration involving process. Depending on the DE, various techniques (symbolic, numerical) are used.

A differential equation of the form  

## First Order Differential Equations

Depending on $F(x,y)$ various methods are used to solve the DE

1. Variable Separable
2. Homogeneous
3. Linear Differential Equations
4. Exact

### Variable Separable

A DE of the form can be solved by separating variables and integration.

### Reducible to Variable Separable

A differential equation of the form,
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=f(ax+by+c)$$
 can be reduced to variable separable by substituting $$z=ax+by+c$$
