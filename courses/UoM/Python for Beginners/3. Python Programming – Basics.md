## 3.1 Expressions and Statements

> Sources: [3.1 Expressions and Statements](https://open.uom.lk/pluginfile.php/4572/mod_hvp/content/10/videos/sources-620a05ec91f66.mp4)  

### Constants

These are fixed values. These can be numbers, letters or strings. String constants are within single quotes (`''`) or double quotes (`""`).

### Variables

These are named places in memory where a programmer can store data. This data can be retrieved by using the name of the variable. Programmers can choose the variable name. The content of a variable can be changed later. 

### Sentences or Lines

In a python program, there are different types of statements.

#### Assignment Statement

 E.g:
  - `x = 5` (Assignment)
  - `x = x + 5` (Assignment with expression)

An assignment statement assigns a value to a variable. On the left-hand side, is the variable to store the result in. On the right-hand side is the value or the expression.

#### Print Statement

E.g:
- `print (x)`

The print statement is used to tell the computer to print the output to the console.

### Numeric Expressions

| Sign | Use            |
| ---- | -------------- |
| +    | Addition       |
| -    | Subtraction    |
| *    | Multiplication |
| /    | Division       |
| **   | Power          |
| %    | Remainder      |

#### Operator Precedence

The order of evaluation when there are more than 1 operator is operator precedence.

| Order | Operator                          |
| ----- | --------------------------------- |
| 1st   | Parenthesis                       |
| 2nd   | Exponent (Power)                  |
| 3rd   | Multiplication/Division/Remainder |
| 4th   | Addition/Subtraction              |
| 5th   | Left to right                     |

It is important to remember the rules from top to bottom. It is a good practice to use parenthesis when writing programs so as to minimize possible confusion. Keeping mathematical expressions simple is important so that they can be easily understood. One thing to recommend would be to break long mathematical operations into smaller, less complicated steps.

## 3.2 Variables and Data Types

A variable is a temporary storage to information that is needed during the lifespan of the program.

### Variable Naming

Python variable names should not start with digits, contain any special characters or be one of the keywords.

To obtain a list of keywords,
```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
```

Here is the list for python 3.11
```python
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import'  
, 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']
```
To improve the readability of the names, you can separate them with underscores as necessary, use Camel Case or Mixed case.

E.g:
- Underscore: first_name
- Camel Case: FirstName
- Mixed Case: firstName

### Data Types

Python variables hold values of different types. Following are a few of the built-in data types of Python.

- Numeric Types (int, float, complex)
- Text Type (str)
- Sequence Types (list, tuple, range)
- Mapping Type (dict)

The type of the variable is set based on the value that you assign to it. Remember that unlike in many other programming languages, Python changes the data type of one variable to another if its value is set to another. The type of these variables can easily be obtained by using the `type()` function.

E.g:
```python
var = 100 #This creates an integer variable with the assigned value
var = "Hello" #Type is changed to string in here
```

In case you need to specifically set a data type to a variable, you can use the constructor functions. Also, you can convert or cast the data type of one variable to another using them.

- `int()` - Constructs an integer from an integer literal, a float (by removing all decimals), or a string (if the string represents a whole number)
- `float()` - Constructs a float number from an integer, a float, or a string (if the string represents a float or an integer)
- `str()` - Constructs a string from a range of data types, including strings, integer, and float literals

Eg:

```python
weight = 55.5 
print(int(weight)) 

#Here the weight which is assigned a float value will be turned to an integer. The output will be just 55.

weight = "55"
print(int (weight) +5)

#In here the weight is converted to int and will display 60 as the output.
```

### Mutable and Immutable Objects

You learnt that everything in Python is an Object, and each variable we use holds an object instance. A unique object id is assigned to an object when it is initiated. But this unique identity can change depending on the mutability of the objects. Mutable objects can be changed after being created, while Immutable ones cannot.

Objects of built-in types like list, set, dict are mutable.

Objects of built-in types like int, float, bool, str, tuple are immutable.

It is recommended to use mutable objects when there is a need to change the size or content of the object later in the program.

However, immutable objects are not always immutable. We learnt that a tuple in python is immutable. But the tuple consists of a sequence of names with unchangeable bindings to objects.

As an example, consider a tuple consisting of a string and a list.

```python
t = ([10, 14, 15], 'John')
```

Strings are immutable, so we can’t change their value. But the contents of the list can be changed. Here the tuple itself isn’t mutable but contains items that are mutable.
