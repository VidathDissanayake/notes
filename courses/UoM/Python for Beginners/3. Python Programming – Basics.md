## 3.1 Expressions and Statements

### Constants

These are fixed values. These can be numbers, letters or strings. String constants are within single quotes (`''`) or double quotes (`""`).

### Variables

These are named places in memory where a programmer can store data. This data can be retrieved by using the name of the variable. Programmers can choose the variable name. The content of a variable can be changed later. 

### Sentences or Lines

In a python program, there are different types of statements.

#### Assignment Statement

 E.g:
  - `x = 5` (Assignment)
  - `x = x + 5` (Assignment with expression)

An assignment statement assigns a value to a variable. On the left-hand side, is the variable to store the result in. On the right-hand side is the value or the expression.

#### Print Statement

E.g:
- `print (x)`

The print statement is used to tell the computer to print the output to the console.

### Numeric Expressions

| Sign | Use            |
| ---- | -------------- |
| +    | Addition       |
| -    | Subtraction    |
| *    | Multiplication |
| /    | Division       |
| **   | Power          |
| %    | Remainder      |

#### Operator Precedence

The order of evaluation when there are more than 1 operator is operator precedence.

| Order | Operator                          |
| ----- | --------------------------------- |
| 1st   | Parenthesis                       |
| 2nd   | Exponent (Power)                  |
| 3rd   | Multiplication/Division/Remainder |
| 4th   | Addition/Subtraction              |
| 5th   | Left to right                     |

It is important to remember the rules from top to bottom. It is a good practice to use parenthesis when writing programs so as to minimize possible confusion. Keeping mathematical expressions simple is important so that they can be easily understood. One thing to recommend would be to break long mathematical operations into smaller, less complicated steps.

A variable is a temporary storage to information that is needed during the lifespan of the program.
