## 3.1 Expressions and Statements

> Links:  
> Sources: [3.1 Expressions and Statements](https://open.uom.lk/pluginfile.php/4572/mod_hvp/content/10/videos/sources-620a05ec91f66.mp4)  

### Constants

These are fixed values. These can be numbers, letters or strings. String constants are within single quotes (`''`) or double quotes (`""`).

### Variables

These are named places in memory where a programmer can store data. This data can be retrieved by using the name of the variable. Programmers can choose the variable name. The content of a variable can be changed later. 

### Sentences or Lines

In a python program, there are different types of statements.

#### Assignment Statement

 E.g:
  - `x = 5` (Assignment)
  - `x = x + 5` (Assignment with expression)

An assignment statement assigns a value to a variable. On the left-hand side, is the variable to store the result in. On the right-hand side is the value or the expression.

#### Print Statement

E.g:
- `print (x)`

The print statement is used to tell the computer to print the output to the console.

### Numeric Expressions

| Sign | Use            |
| ---- | -------------- |
| +    | Addition       |
| -    | Subtraction    |
| *    | Multiplication |
| /    | Division       |
| **   | Power          |
| %    | Remainder      |

#### Operator Precedence

The order of evaluation when there are more than 1 operator is operator precedence.

| Order | Operator                          |
| ----- | --------------------------------- |
| 1st   | Parenthesis                       |
| 2nd   | Exponent (Power)                  |
| 3rd   | Multiplication/Division/Remainder |
| 4th   | Addition/Subtraction              |
| 5th   | Left to right                     |

![order of precedence](assets/images/order%20of%20precedence.png)

It is important to remember the rules from top to bottom. It is a good practice to use parenthesis when writing programs so as to minimize possible confusion. Keeping mathematical expressions simple is important so that they can be easily understood. One thing to recommend would be to break long mathematical operations into smaller, less complicated steps.

## 3.2 Variables and Data Types

> Links:  
> Sources: [3.2 Variables and Data Types](https://open.uom.lk/pluginfile.php/4573/mod_hvp/content/11/videos/sources-620a08953b101.mp4)  

A variable is a temporary storage to information that is needed during the lifespan of the program.

### Variable Naming

Python variable names should not start with digits, contain any special characters or be one of the keywords.

To obtain a list of keywords,
```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
```

Here is the list for python 3.11
```python
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import'  
, 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']
```
To improve the readability of the names, you can separate them with underscores as necessary, use Camel Case or Mixed case.

E.g:
- Underscore: first_name
- Camel Case: FirstName
- Mixed Case: firstName

### Data Types

Python variables hold values of different types. Following are a few of the built-in data types of Python.

- Numeric Types (int, float, complex)
- Text Type (str)
- Sequence Types (list, tuple, range)
- Mapping Type (dict)

The type of the variable is set based on the value that you assign to it. Remember that unlike in many other programming languages, Python changes the data type of one variable to another if its value is set to another. The type of these variables can easily be obtained by using the `type()` function.

E.g:
```python
var = 100 #This creates an integer variable with the assigned value
var = "Hello" #Type is changed to string in here
```

In case you need to specifically set a data type to a variable, you can use the constructor functions. Also, you can convert or cast the data type of one variable to another using them.

- `int()` - Constructs an integer from an integer literal, a float (by removing all decimals), or a string (if the string represents a whole number)
- `float()` - Constructs a float number from an integer, a float, or a string (if the string represents a float or an integer)
- `str()` - Constructs a string from a range of data types, including strings, integer, and float literals

Eg:

```python
weight = 55.5 
print(int(weight)) 

#Here the weight which is assigned a float value will be turned to an integer. The output will be just 55.

weight = "55"
print(int (weight) +5)

#In here the weight is converted to int and will display 60 as the output.
```

### Mutable and Immutable Objects

You learnt that everything in Python is an Object, and each variable we use holds an object instance. A unique object id is assigned to an object when it is initiated. But this unique identity can change depending on the mutability of the objects. Mutable objects can be changed after being created, while Immutable ones cannot.

Objects of built-in types like list, set, dict are mutable.

Objects of built-in types like int, float, bool, str, tuple are immutable.

It is recommended to use mutable objects when there is a need to change the size or content of the object later in the program.

However, immutable objects are not always immutable. We learnt that a tuple in python is immutable. But the tuple consists of a sequence of names with unchangeable bindings to objects.

As an example, consider a tuple consisting of a string and a list.

```python
t = ([10, 14, 15], 'John')
```

Strings are immutable, so we can’t change their value. But the contents of the list can be changed. Here the tuple itself isn’t mutable but contains items that are mutable.

## 3.3 Operators

> Sources: [3.3 Operators](https://open.uom.lk/lms/pluginfile.php/4574/mod_hvp/content/12/videos/sources-620a0ae3429d0.mp4)

Operators perform operations on operands. These operands can be variables or values.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used for performing common mathematical operations in Python.

![arithmetic operators](assets/images/arithmetic%20operators.png)

We have the basic arithmetic operators: Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplication. 

Then we have two types of Division: Standard Division and Floor Division. Standard Division always results in a float. Whereas in the Floor Division, the fractional portion of the result is truncated, and only the integer part is kept.

```python
>>> x=13  
>>> y=2  
>>> x+y  
15  
>>> x-y  
11  
>>> x*y  
26  
>>> x/y  
6.5  
>>> x%y  
1  
>>> x**y  
169  
>>> x//y  
```

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used for assigning values to the variables or any other object in Python.

![assignment operators](assets/images/assignment%20operators.png)


### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used for comparing two values. Since it returns either true or false, comparison operators are typically used in Boolean contexts. They are especially used in conditional and loop statements in order to direct program flow.

![comparison operators](assets/images/comparison%20operatos.png)

### Logical Operators

Logical operators “and”, “or”, and “not” operators are used to compare two conditional statements. The logical operators modify and join together expressions evaluated in Boolean context to create more complex conditions.

![logical operators](assets/images/logical%20operators.png)

### Identity Operators

Identity operators "is" and "is not" are used to compare two objects. Not if they are equal but if they are actually the same object located on the same part of the memory. Hence, two equal objects do not necessarily imply that they are identical, with the same identity.

```python
>>> x = ["a", "b"]  
>>> y = ["a", "b"]  
>>> print(x is y)  
False  
>>>    
>>> z = x  
>>> print(x is z)  
True  
>>>    
>>> print(id(x))  
139993861790400  
>>> print(id(y))  
139993861792704  
>>> print(id(z))  
139993861790400
```

x and y both refer to lists containing the same elements. They are equal but not identical, as they do not reference the same object in memory. So, when you try x is y, it returns false. You can verify that x and y do not refer to the same object by using the id() function.

When you make an assignment like x = z, Python merely creates a second reference to the same object. Therefore, when you try x is z, it returns true. Both x and z have the same object identity.

### Membership Operators

Membership operators "in" and "not in" are used to test whether a  value or variable is found in a sequence. A sequence can be anything from a string, a list, a tuple, a set, or a dictionary. Similar to identity operators, membership operators also return Boolean values.

```python
>>> list = ["a", "b"]  
>>> print("a" in list)  
True  
>>> print("c" not in list)  
True
```

### Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are similar to logical operators, but treat operands as binary values and operate on them bit by bit. 

![bitwise operators](assets/images/bitwise%20operators.png)

We also have the right shift and left shift operators. Left shift shifts left a binary value by pushing zeros in from the right and letting the leftmost bits fall off. Right shift, shifts right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and letting the rightmost bits fall off. 

In binary, 5=101 and 7=111. In Python, integers are usually represented by 32 bit values. 

```python
>>> x=5  
>>> y=7  
>>> x&y  
5  
>>> x|y  
7  
>>> x^y  
2
>>> x>>2  
1  
>>> x<<2  
20
```


## 3.4 Conditional Execution

> Links:  
> Sources: [3.4 Conditional Execution](https://open.uom.lk/lms/pluginfile.php/4575/mod_hvp/content/13/videos/sources-620a0c364dc47.mp4)

The simplest form of conditional execution in Python is the “if” statement. “if” is a keyword in python followed by a logical expression that returns either True or False. An if statement always ends with a colon.

The instructions/code to be executed if the “if condition” returned True are indented under the if statement. Python uses these indentations to mark the scope of the if statement. As opposed to many other programming languages, Python's leading whitespaces carry syntactical meaning. 

```python
if time >  12:
    print("Good Afternoon!")
```

If it returns False, the program simply does nothing. But it is often useful to write code that has an alternative choice. For this, we can use an if-else combination.

```python
if time < 12:
    print("Good Morning!")
else:
    print("Good Afternoon!")
```

A multi way condition can be implemented using the Python's "elif" keyword. Elif can be understood as an "else-if". Using elifs, the program is able to choose one of many paths.

```python
if marks > 75:
    print(“A”)

elif 60 <= marks < 75:
    print(“B")

elif 40 <= marks < 60:
    print("C")

else:
    print(“F")
```

Unlike with the use of several if statements one after the other, with the use of elifs, the program checks the following elif conditions only if the first if statement returns False. If any of the subsequent elif conditions return True, we execute that particular branch and skip over the elif conditions that follow.
