### Introduction to Lists

List is one of the popular data structures. A list holds comma-separated values between square brackets. Following are some sample lists in Python.
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
list_2 = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’]  
list_3 = [‘apple’, ‘orange’, 2000, 69.6]
```

Values within a list need not be of the same data type. For example, in list_3, ‘apple’ and ‘orange’ are strings, 2000 is an integer, and 69.6 is a floating-point number.

### Accessing Values in a List

To locate the values in a list, the lists in Python are indexed. Consider the following Python list. 

```python
values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]
```

![list indexing](assets/images/list%20indexing.png)

Two important properties of indexing are,
- The index of the first value is 0 (not 1).
- The values are indexed from left to right.

The following Python code illustrates how to access the values in a list.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17] 
>>> print(values[0]) 
15 
>>> print(values[4]) 
17 
```

In addition to accessing a single value at a time, Python also allows extracting a section of values from a list. The following code illustrates how it is achieved.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]
>>> print(values[0:3]) 
[15, 20, 96] 
>>> print(values[2:5]) 
[96, 32, 17]
```

It is evident from the above examples that if the specified index range is `[m:n]`, the values considered are from index m to index (n-1). For example, `values[0:3]` considers the values from 15 to 96 where 15 is at index 0 and 96 is at index 2 (not 3).

### Appending Values to a List

To append 60 to this list, which means adding 60 to the end of this list, the `append()` method can be used. The following code demonstrates how the `append()` method is used.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]  
>>> values.append(60)
>>> print(values)
[15, 20, 96, 32, 17, 60]
```

### Updating a Value in a List

Suppose we need to update the value at index 2, which is 96, to 60. It can be achieved in the following manner.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]  
>>> values[2] = 60
>>> print(values)
[15, 20, 60, 32, 17]
```

### Deleting a Value from a List

Suppose we need to delete the value at index 1. It can be achieved using the `remove()` method as shown below.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]  
>>> values.remove(20) 
>>> print(values)
[15, 96, 32, 17]
```

The output does not contain 20 which was the value at index 1. One drawback in using the `remove()` method is that the value at the specific index should be known. For example, in the above example, the `remove()` method cannot be used if we do not know that 20 is the value at index 1. In scenarios where the value at a specific index is not known, an alternative approach is to use the `del` (delete) keyword. See the following example.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]  
>>> del values[1] 
>>> print(values)
[15, 96, 32, 17] 
```

The `del` keyword does not need the value at an index to be known.

### Multidimensional Lists

Using 2-dimensional lists is an easy approach to represent matrices in Python. The following is a 2-dimensional list that stores the matrix given in Figure 3 above.

```python
data = [[1,1,1], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]]
```

There are three lists inside another list. Each internal list holds the values of a row in the matrix. For example, the first internal list contains the values [1,1,1] which is the first row in the matrix.  

Accessing the values in a 2-dimensional list is similar to accessing values in a matrix. Suppose we want to access the value in the center square (a22). In the 2-dimensional list data, it is in the internal list at index 1 and inside that internal list, it is at index 1 again.

```python
>>> data = [[1,1,1], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]]
>>> print(data[1][1])
2
```

Other list operations such as update, append, and delete also work similarly.

```python
>>>  data = [[1,1,1], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]]
>>> data[1][1] = 25
>>> print(data)
[[1,1,1], [2,25,2], [3,3,3]]
>>> data[1].append(2)
>>> print(data)
[[1,1,1], [2,25,2,2], [3,3,3]]
```
