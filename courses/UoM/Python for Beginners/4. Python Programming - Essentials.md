### Introduction to Lists

List is one of the popular data structures. A list holds comma-separated values between square brackets. Following are some sample lists in Python.
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
list_2 = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’]  
list_3 = [‘apple’, ‘orange’, 2000, 69.6]
```

Values within a list need not be of the same data type. For example, in list_3, ‘apple’ and ‘orange’ are strings, 2000 is an integer, and 69.6 is a floating-point number.

### Accessing Values in a List

To locate the values in a list, the lists in Python are indexed. Consider the following Python list. 

```python
values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]
```

![list indexing](assets/images/list%20indexing.png)

Two important properties of indexing are,
- The index of the first value is 0 (not 1).
- The values are indexed from left to right.

The following Python code illustrates how to access the values in a list.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17] 
>>> print(values[0]) 
15 
>>> print(values[4]) 
17 
```

In addition to accessing a single value at a time, Python also allows extracting a section of values from a list. The following code illustrates how it is achieved.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]
>>> print(values[0:3]) 
[15, 20, 96] 
>>> print(values[2:5]) 
[96, 32, 17]
```

It is evident from the above examples that if the specified index range is `[m:n]`, the values considered are from index m to index (n-1). For example, `values[0:3]` considers the values from 15 to 96 where 15 is at index 0 and 96 is at index 2 (not 3).

### Appending Values to a List

To append 60 to this list, which means adding 60 to the end of this list, the `append()` method can be used. The following code demonstrates how the `append()` method is used.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]  
>>> values.append(60)
>>> print(values)
[15, 20, 96, 32, 17, 60]
```

### Updating a Value in a List

Suppose we need to update the value at index 2, which is 96, to 60. It can be achieved in the following manner.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]  
>>> values[2] = 60
>>> print(values)
[15, 20, 60, 32, 17]
```

### Deleting a Value from a List

Suppose we need to delete the value at index 1. It can be achieved using the `remove()` method as shown below.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]  
>>> values.remove(20) 
>>> print(values)
[15, 96, 32, 17]
```

The output does not contain 20 which was the value at index 1. One drawback in using the `remove()` method is that the value at the specific index should be known. For example, in the above example, the `remove()` method cannot be used if we do not know that 20 is the value at index 1. In scenarios where the value at a specific index is not known, an alternative approach is to use the `del` (delete) keyword. See the following example.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]  
>>> del values[1] 
>>> print(values)
[15, 96, 32, 17] 
```

The `del` keyword does not need the value at an index to be known.

### Multidimensional Lists

![structure of a matrix](assets/images/structure%20of%20a%20matrix.png)

![a simple matrix](assets/images/a%20simple%20matrix.png)

Using 2-dimensional lists is an easy approach to represent matrices in Python. The following is a 2-dimensional list that stores the matrix given in Figure 3 above.

```python
data = [[1,1,1], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]]
```

There are three lists inside another list. Each internal list holds the values of a row in the matrix. For example, the first internal list contains the values [1,1,1] which is the first row in the matrix.  

Accessing the values in a 2-dimensional list is similar to accessing values in a matrix. Suppose we want to access the value in the center square (a22). In the 2-dimensional list data, it is in the internal list at index 1 and inside that internal list, it is at index 1 again.

```python
>>> data = [[1,1,1], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]]
>>> print(data[1][1])
2
```

Other list operations such as update, append, and delete also work similarly.

```python
>>>  data = [[1,1,1], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]]
>>> data[1][1] = 25
>>> print(data)
[[1,1,1], [2,25,2], [3,3,3]]
>>> data[1].append(2)
>>> print(data)
[[1,1,1], [2,25,2,2], [3,3,3]]
```

### List Operations

#### Length

To find the size/length of a list, the function `len` (stands for length) can be used. See the following example.
```python
>>> len([1,2,3])
3
```
The length of this list is 3 as the list contains 3 values.

#### Concatenation

Suppose there are two lists a and b. The contents of lists a and b can be combined using the plus (+) operator. `a+b` will output a single list with contents from lists a and b.
```python
>>> a = [1,2,3]
>>> b = [4,5,6]
>>> print(a+b)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

#### Repetition

Multiplying by 4 does not create 4 separate lists but a single list where the contents of the original list are multiplied 4 times.
```python
>>> print([‘Hi’] * 4)
[‘Hi’, ‘Hi’, ‘Hi’, ‘Hi’]
```

#### Membership

Membership checks whether a value is available in a list.
```python
>>> print(3 in [1,2,3])
True
```
The `in` operator is used to check membership. Statement `3 in [1,2,3]` checks whether value 3 is available in the list. Since the value is available, it returns `True`. If the value is not available, it will return `False.

#### Iteration

Iteration means going through the list one element at a time.
```python
>>> for x in [1,2,3]:
        print(x)
1
2
3
```

#### Indexing and Slicing

Consider the list `L=['a', 'b', 'c']`

|                       |            |                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Python Expression** | **Result** | **Description**                         |
| L[2]                  | 'c'        | Indices start at zero                   |
| L[-2]                 | 'b'        | Negative indexing is from right to left |
| L[1:]                 | ['b', 'c'] | Slicing extracts sections               |

![indexing](assets/images/indexing.png)

Slicing means extracting a part of the list. Using the range m to n within square brackets (`L[m:n]`) will consider the values from index m to index (n-1). In addition to what has been discussed in previous sections, the second part of the range is empty in `L[1:]`. It means from index 1 up to the last value of the list.

## 4.2 Loops and Iterations

Iteration is the repeated execution of the same block of code.

![sequence, condition, loop](assets/images/sequence,%20condition,%20loop.png)

Considering the nature of iterations, these can be categorized as,

1. Definite iteration, in which the number of repetitions is specified explicitly in advance
2. Indefinite iteration, in which the code block executes until some condition is met

In Python, indefinite iteration is performed with a while loop, and definite iteration is implemented with for loops.


### The for Loop

In the for loop the block of code is repeated or iterated a specific number of times. The format of the code or the syntax of the code is to have the for Keyword and tell that for each iterating variable in the sequence needs to loop through the code.
```python
for iterating_var in sequence:
    statements(s)
```
`for` and `in` are the two keywords. The `iterating_var` and the `sequence` are variables that we define. The sequence can be a list of numbers where each time the iterating variable will be taking an item starting from the first one until it reaches the end of the list. And we also have a colon.

The block of statements repeated is called the loop body. The loop body needs to be indented to the right so that the computer understands the block of code belongs to this loop.

### Range Function

It may be not practical for us to type the sequence of items that we want the iterating variable to take. So we have the range function to create the sequence of numbers we want. 

One way of indicating range function is to input when to stop the sequence. So if we input 10 the sequence will have 10 numbers from 0 to 9. The sequence ends at 9 because 0 is counted as an item in the sequence.

**range(stop)**
example:

```python
>>> list(range(10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

If we do not want to start from 0 we can indicate where we want to start the sequence. In this example, we want the start variable to be 5 and the stop variable to be 10. Note that the list will go from 5 to 9. Let's create a range less than 10

**range(start,stop)**
example:

```python
>>> list(range(5, 10))
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

If you do not want to increment by 1 then you can indicate how you want to step or increment each item.   
 
**range(start,stop,step)**
example:

```python
>>> list(range(0, 10, 3))
[0, 3, 6, 9]
```

### The while Loop

The basic syntax of the Python while loop is,

```python
while <condition>:
      <statement(s)>
```

The <condition> is evaluated in the form of a Boolean expression, which turns out either to be true or false. The loop body is executed only if the <condition> is true. It is repeatedly evaluated in each iteration before entering into the loop body.
