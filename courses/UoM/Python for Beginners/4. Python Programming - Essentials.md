> Sources: [4.1 Lists](https://open.uom.lk/lms/pluginfile.php/4577/mod_hvp/content/15/videos/sources-620a0dee22f11.mp4)

### Introduction to Lists

List is one of the popular data structures. A list holds comma-separated values between square brackets. Following are some sample lists in Python.
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
list_2 = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’]  
list_3 = [‘apple’, ‘orange’, 2000, 69.6]
```

Values within a list need not be of the same data type. For example, in list_3, ‘apple’ and ‘orange’ are strings, 2000 is an integer, and 69.6 is a floating-point number.

### Accessing Values in a List

To locate the values in a list, the lists in Python are indexed. Consider the following Python list. 

```python
values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]
```

![list indexing](assets/images/list%20indexing.png)

Two important properties of indexing are,
- The index of the first value is 0 (not 1).
- The values are indexed from left to right.

The following Python code illustrates how to access the values in a list.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17] 
>>> print(values[0]) 
15 
>>> print(values[4]) 
17 
```

In addition to accessing a single value at a time, Python also allows extracting a section of values from a list. The following code illustrates how it is achieved.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]
>>> print(values[0:3]) 
[15, 20, 96] 
>>> print(values[2:5]) 
[96, 32, 17]
```

It is evident from the above examples that if the specified index range is `[m:n]`, the values considered are from index m to index (n-1). For example, `values[0:3]` considers the values from 15 to 96 where 15 is at index 0 and 96 is at index 2 (not 3).

### Appending Values to a List

To append 60 to this list, which means adding 60 to the end of this list, the `append()` method can be used. The following code demonstrates how the `append()` method is used.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]  
>>> values.append(60)
>>> print(values)
[15, 20, 96, 32, 17, 60]
```

### Updating a Value in a List

Suppose we need to update the value at index 2, which is 96, to 60. It can be achieved in the following manner.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]  
>>> values[2] = 60
>>> print(values)
[15, 20, 60, 32, 17]
```

### Deleting a Value from a List

Suppose we need to delete the value at index 1. It can be achieved using the `remove()` method as shown below.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]  
>>> values.remove(20) 
>>> print(values)
[15, 96, 32, 17]
```

The output does not contain 20 which was the value at index 1. One drawback in using the `remove()` method is that the value at the specific index should be known. For example, in the above example, the `remove()` method cannot be used if we do not know that 20 is the value at index 1. In scenarios where the value at a specific index is not known, an alternative approach is to use the `del` (delete) keyword. See the following example.

```python
>>> values = [15, 20, 96, 32, 17]  
>>> del values[1] 
>>> print(values)
[15, 96, 32, 17] 
```

The `del` keyword does not need the value at an index to be known.

### Multidimensional Lists

![structure of a matrix](assets/images/structure%20of%20a%20matrix.png)

![a simple matrix](assets/images/a%20simple%20matrix.png)

Using 2-dimensional lists is an easy approach to represent matrices in Python. The following is a 2-dimensional list that stores the matrix given in Figure 3 above.

```python
data = [[1,1,1], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]]
```

There are three lists inside another list. Each internal list holds the values of a row in the matrix. For example, the first internal list contains the values [1,1,1] which is the first row in the matrix.  

Accessing the values in a 2-dimensional list is similar to accessing values in a matrix. Suppose we want to access the value in the center square (a22). In the 2-dimensional list data, it is in the internal list at index 1 and inside that internal list, it is at index 1 again.

```python
>>> data = [[1,1,1], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]]
>>> print(data[1][1])
2
```

Other list operations such as update, append, and delete also work similarly.

```python
>>>  data = [[1,1,1], [2,2,2], [3,3,3]]
>>> data[1][1] = 25
>>> print(data)
[[1,1,1], [2,25,2], [3,3,3]]
>>> data[1].append(2)
>>> print(data)
[[1,1,1], [2,25,2,2], [3,3,3]]
```

### List Operations

#### Length

To find the size/length of a list, the function `len` (stands for length) can be used. See the following example.
```python
>>> len([1,2,3])
3
```
The length of this list is 3 as the list contains 3 values.

#### Concatenation

Suppose there are two lists a and b. The contents of lists a and b can be combined using the plus (+) operator. `a+b` will output a single list with contents from lists a and b.
```python
>>> a = [1,2,3]
>>> b = [4,5,6]
>>> print(a+b)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

#### Repetition

Multiplying by 4 does not create 4 separate lists but a single list where the contents of the original list are multiplied 4 times.
```python
>>> print([‘Hi’] * 4)
[‘Hi’, ‘Hi’, ‘Hi’, ‘Hi’]
```

#### Membership

Membership checks whether a value is available in a list.
```python
>>> print(3 in [1,2,3])
True
```
The `in` operator is used to check membership. Statement `3 in [1,2,3]` checks whether value 3 is available in the list. Since the value is available, it returns `True`. If the value is not available, it will return `False.

#### Iteration

Iteration means going through the list one element at a time.
```python
>>> for x in [1,2,3]:
        print(x)
1
2
3
```

#### Indexing and Slicing

Consider the list `L=['a', 'b', 'c']`

|                       |            |                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Python Expression** | **Result** | **Description**                         |
| L[2]                  | 'c'        | Indices start at zero                   |
| L[-2]                 | 'b'        | Negative indexing is from right to left |
| L[1:]                 | ['b', 'c'] | Slicing extracts sections               |

![indexing](assets/images/indexing.png)

Slicing means extracting a part of the list. Using the range m to n within square brackets (`L[m:n]`) will consider the values from index m to index (n-1). In addition to what has been discussed in previous sections, the second part of the range is empty in `L[1:]`. It means from index 1 up to the last value of the list.

## 4.2 Loops and Iterations

> Links:
> Sources: [4.2 Loops and Iterations](https://open.uom.lk/lms/pluginfile.php/4580/mod_hvp/content/18/videos/files-61f7566c979af.mp4)

Iteration is the repeated execution of the same block of code.

![sequence, condition, loop](assets/images/sequence,%20condition,%20loop.png)

Considering the nature of iterations, these can be categorized as,

1. Definite iteration, in which the number of repetitions is specified explicitly in advance
2. Indefinite iteration, in which the code block executes until some condition is met

In Python, indefinite iteration is performed with a while loop, and definite iteration is implemented with for loops.


### The for Loop

In the for loop the block of code is repeated or iterated a specific number of times. The format of the code or the syntax of the code is to have the for Keyword and tell that for each iterating variable in the sequence needs to loop through the code.
```python
for iterating_var in sequence:
    statements(s)
```
`for` and `in` are the two keywords. The `iterating_var` and the `sequence` are variables that we define. The sequence can be a list of numbers where each time the iterating variable will be taking an item starting from the first one until it reaches the end of the list. And we also have a colon.

The block of statements repeated is called the loop body. The loop body needs to be indented to the right so that the computer understands the block of code belongs to this loop.

### Range Function

It may be not practical for us to type the sequence of items that we want the iterating variable to take. So we have the range function to create the sequence of numbers we want. 

One way of indicating range function is to input when to stop the sequence. So if we input 10 the sequence will have 10 numbers from 0 to 9. The sequence ends at 9 because 0 is counted as an item in the sequence.

**range(stop)**
example:

```python
>>> list(range(10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

If we do not want to start from 0 we can indicate where we want to start the sequence. In this example, we want the start variable to be 5 and the stop variable to be 10. Note that the list will go from 5 to 9. Let's create a range less than 10

**range(start,stop)**
example:

```python
>>> list(range(5, 10))
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

If you do not want to increment by 1 then you can indicate how you want to step or increment each item.   
 
**range(start,stop,step)**
example:

```python
>>> list(range(0, 10, 3))
[0, 3, 6, 9]
```

### The while Loop

The basic syntax of the Python while loop is,

```python
while <condition>:
      <statement(s)>
```

The `<condition>` is evaluated in the form of a Boolean expression, which turns out either to be true or false. The loop body is executed only if the `<condition>` is true. It is repeatedly evaluated in each iteration before entering into the loop body.
```python
num = 5
while (num !=0) :
    print ('Hello World!')
        num = num - 1
```
 Output will be:
```python
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
```

### Break and Continue statements

Python allows terminating the iteration of the loop prematurely with the break and continue keywords. 

With the break statement, the loop can immediately be terminated in entirety. Once a break statement is met within the loop ,the loop is exited and the program execution is passed to the first statement that appears after the loop body.

With the continue statement, the current loop iteration is immediately terminated.This statement skips the rest of the loop statement and starts the next iteration of the loop to take place.

In while loops,
![while break and continue](assets/images/while%20break%20and%20continue.png)

The behaviour is the same for while loops.

### Using ‘else’ with Loops

Python allows using an ‘else’ clause with loops:
- If the ‘else’ clause is used with a for loop, the ‘else’ clause is executed when the loop has iterated the sequence given.
- If the ‘else’ clause is used with a while loop, the ‘else’ clause is executed when the loop condition becomes false.
Assuming loop is not exiting with a break.

![else in loops](assets/images/else%20in%20loops.png)

### Selecting the Loop

- The ‘for’ loop is generally used when the number of iterations or the sequence can be identified at program compilation or before execution of loop.
- The ‘while’ loop can be used for any other situations.

### Nested Loops

We can also have nested loops. We can put a loop inside a loop to make a nested loop. The syntax is as given where we indent the loop inside the out loop. When we execute for each iteration of the outer loop the entire inner loop will be iterated. Once it is finished it will go to the outer loop and take the next iterating variable from the outer loop and once again completely execute the inner loop iteration.

![nested loops](assets/images/nested%20loops.png)

![nested loop example](assets/images/nested%20loop%20example.png)

### The pass Keyword

Pass does not change the loop execution but it can be used to do nothing in a loop. In a loop we cannot have an empty block of code inside a loop. So we can use the pass to write some code with loop that does nothing.

If we write the code without any executable code for the loop body other than the comment it will give a syntax error. How we can avoid that is to put a pass statement inside the loop.

## 4.3 Input and Output

> Links:
> Sources: [4.3 Input and Output](https://open.uom.lk/lms/pluginfile.php/4581/mod_hvp/content/19/videos/sources-620a1164822ca.mp4)

### Input

We can use the built-in method `input()` to obtain a text input from a user. If necessary, it is also possible to include a prompt that provides additional context.
```python
>>> input("Enter your name: ")
Enter your name: Vidath
'Vidath'
```
When an input statement is executed, the program pauses till the user provides an input. 

By default, python takes the input as a string. We can convert it to another type by using a method such as `int()`.
```python
>>> x = input("Enter a number: ")
Enter a number: 25
>>> type(x)
<class 'str'>
>>> x = int(x)
>>> type(x)
<class 'int'>
```

We can also wrap the input in the method to do this in one step.
```python
>>> x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
Enter a number: 25
>>> type(x)
<class 'int'>
```

### Output

To output text, we can use the built-in method `print()`. The value that is needed to be printed is passed inside the brackets.
```python
>>> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
>>> print(1024)
1024
```
Multiple values can be printed inline by separating them by commas. By default, this will print with spaces as the separator. The separator can be changed by adding `sep='<seperator>'` to the end of the list of values. The line ending can be changed by passing a value for `end='<end>'` similarly. The default value is `\n` which is the newline character.
```python
>>> print(1,2,3,4)
1 2 3 4
>>> print(1,2,3,4, sep='-')
1-2-3-4
>>> print(1,2,3,4, sep='*', end='#')
1*2*3*4#>>>
>>> print(1,2,3,4, sep='*', end='#\n')
1*2*3*4#
```

To make the output more presentable according to a template, we can use string formatting. We can use curly braces (`{}`) as placeholders and fill those placeholders with `.format()` at the end of the string. The order can be specified by putting the index inside the curly brackets.
```python
>>> a=1; b=2;  
>>> print("Value of a is {} and value of b is {}.".format(a,b))  
Value of a is 1 and value of b is 2.
>>> print("Value of a is {1} and value of b is {0}.".format(a,b))  
Value of a is 2 and value of b is 1.
```

## 4.4 Functions

> Links:
> Sources: [4.4 Functions](https://open.uom.lk/lms/pluginfile.php/4582/mod_hvp/content/20/videos/files-61f7b8fabb65e.mp4)

In programming, a function is a self-contained block of code that encapsulates a specific task or related group of tasks. They run only when specifically called within the program. The prime advantage of functions is the code re-usability and manageability.

### Built-in Functions

There are in-built functions in python such as `print()` and `input()`. In these built-in functions, the code that accomplishes the task is abstracted out from the programmer who only needs to know the function arguments and the values it's returning.

### User Defined Functions

The usual syntax for defining a Python function is as,
```python
def <function_name>([<parameters>]):
    "function_docstring"
    <statement(s)>
```
`def` is the keyword that we use to inform Python of the new function we are creating. `<function_name>` is the identifier, and this should also follow the naming conventions. The component named `<parameter/s>` is optional. It is there to provide the parameters to be passed to the function, if any are needed.  The `"function_docstring"` is used to provide a brief description of what the function does. The indented `<statement/s>` compose the function body defining the functionality. The statements that are needed to be executed when the function is called are included there.

The syntax for calling a Python function is as,

```python
<function_name>([<arguments>])
```
`<arguments>` are the values that are passed into the function when it is called. They correspond to the `<parameters>` in the particular function definition.

Here is a sample function definition.

```python
def my_fucntion():
    print(“Hello from a function!”)
```

Calling this function as `my_function()` would execute the function body statements and print a line on screen as "Hello from a function!"

```python
>>> def my_function():
    print("Hello from a function")

>>> my_function()
Hello from a function
```

Even if you define a function that does not need taking any arguments, the parentheses are a must.

Sometimes you may need to define a function with an empty body, one that does nothing. This is usually to act as a placeholder until the function is implemented at a later level. Anyhow, when you define empty functions you must use the pass statement.

```python
def empty_func():
   pass
empty_func()
```
#### Passing Arguments

##### Positional Arguments

Positional Arguments is the most common and straightforward method of passing arguments to function. During the definition of the function you also specify the list of parameters that the function accepts, within parenthesis as below.

```python
# Function definition
def calc(qty, item, price):
    print("The"+ item + " cost/s" , (qty*price), "rupees")

# Function Call
calc(2,'Apples', 20)

# Output
The Apples cost/s 40 rupees
```

#### Keyword Arguments

Another way to call the functions is with Keyword arguments, where you can specify the passed arguments in `<keyword>=<value>` format. The `<keyword>` is what you have provided as the parameter, and the value is the actual parameter value you want to pass to the function.

The previous function `calc()` can also be called with keyword arguments as shown below.

```python
def calc(qty, item, price):  
      print("The "+ item + " cost/s", (qty*price), "rupees")

calc(qty=5, item="Oranges",price=10)
```

The speciality with Keyword arguments use is that you don’t need to worry about the argument order like you did previously. As each argument you pass is specified with the parameter/Keyword name Python can identify the values even though the order is messed up.

However, here too, the number of arguments should be equal to what is defined in the function.


#### Default Parameters

In Functions defined with default parameters, if no argument is passed during the function call, a predefined default parameter is passed as the value for the function. Such parameters are specified in Python function definition in the `<name>=<value>`, format. This `<value>` becomes a default value for that parameter.

```python
def greet(name, msg="How are you?"):
   print(name + ", " msg)

greet("John")
greet("John", "Good Evening")
greet("Good Evening")

John, How are you?
John, Good Evening
Good Evening, How are you?
```

You can see in the above examples, when any arguments are left out, the function assumes its default value.


#### Arbitrary Arguments

In some function definitions, you will not know the exact number of arguments that need to be passed to the function during its call. In such situations you can use the *args syntax with the function definition.

```python
def add(*args):  
    #sum() is an inbuilt function to sum up a list  
    total=(sum(args))    print("The sum : " ,total)  
  
def greet(msg, *names):  
    for name in names:  
        print(msg + ", " + name)  
  
#Calling add() function  
add(1,4,5)  
  
#Calling greet() function  
greet("Hello","John","Maggie","Lucy")  
  
The sum:10  
Hello, John  
Hello, Maggie  
Hello, Lucy
```

#### The return Statement

A return statement in a Python function can serve either terminate the function immediately and pass the control of execution back to the caller OR pass any required data back to the function caller.

In the first situation we just include the return statement but whenever we are returning a specific value/s from the function we need to mention that together with the return statement. And these returned values can be captured by another function or a variable as the program prefers.

A Python function can return any type of object. And Python allows returning multiple values, separated by commas. There they are actually returned as a tuple.

```python
def calc(quantity, price):
    return quantity*price

print("The Price is " , calc(10,750))

The Price is 7500
```

#### Docstrings

The Docstrings are supposed to provide detailed documentation for a function. It can be composed of the function’s purpose, its list of arguments, its return values and any other information that the programmer thinks important to mention.

A docstring is added as the first statement in the body of a Python function. These need to be within quotation marks and the recommended convention to use the triple-quotes (in double quotes) as `"""docstring"""` . These can be on a single line or be multi lined as well. If the docstring fits on a single line both the opening and closing quotes should be on the same line.

We can also view the docstrings of built-in and user defined functions using the `__doc__` attribute.

```python
def calc(quantity, price):
    """Returns the product of quantity and price"""
    return quantity*price

print (calc.__doc__)

Returns the product of quantity and price
```


Docstrings seem to be similar to the commenting. But the difference is that comments are not accessible for viewing during the program execution. And the purpose docstrings serve is different, they are in fact a more useful way of commenting.

```python
>>> print(print.__doc__)

print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
Optional keyword arguments:
file:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
sep:   string inserted between values, default a space.
end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.
flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.
```


## 4.5 Errors

> Links:
> Sources: [4.5 Errors](https://open.uom.lk/lms/pluginfile.php/4583/mod_hvp/content/21/videos/sources-62147f079361f.mp4)

- [Syntax Errors](#Syntax%20Errors) are mistakes in using the programming language. Each programming language has its own syntax, and we should write them correctly.
- [Runtime Errors](#Runtime%20Errors) occur when a script or a function is executing. These are sometimes referred to as Execution time errors.
- [Logical Errors](#Logical%20Errors) would not generate any error messages, but they would result in unexpected or erroneous output.

### Syntax Errors

```python
>>> print('Hello, World!)  
 File "<stdin>", line 1  
   print('Hello, World!)  
         ^  
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)
```

### Runtime Errors

Runtime errors occur whenever syntactically correct Python code results in errors at the run-time. There will be an error message telling us what went wrong.

It is important to know that whenever a runtime error occur, and it is not handled properly, your Python program will terminate after that point of error. Meaning, the program will not continue to execute, and you will not be able to get the expected task done. 

There are many types of runtime errors in Python.

- [NameError](#NameError)
- [IndexError](#IndexError)
- [TypeError](#TypeError)
- [ValueError](#ValueError)
- [ImportError](#ImportError)

#### NameError

A ‘NameError’ occurs when you try to reference a variable that has not been defined in the code. 
```python
>>> number = 10
>>> print(num)
Traceback (most recent call last):  
 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>  
NameError: name 'num' is not defined. Did you mean: 'sum'?
```
In the example you see a variable named `number` with value 10. Then we try to print the value of a variable named `num`. Therefore, Python is complaining about a `NameError` and says `name 'num' is not defined`.

#### IndexError

This error happens when we try to access a value from a sequence, but the referenced index is out of range.
```python
>>> num_list = [1,2,3]  
>>> print(num_list[10])  
Traceback (most recent call last):  
 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>  
IndexError: list index out of range
```
In this example, `my_list` only has three items, the index is ranging from 0 to 2. But we are trying to access the item at index 10, which is not available. That is why Python is raising an `IndeError`.

#### TypeError



#### ValueError
#### ImportError


### Logical Errors
