Computational thinking is an approach to solving problem systematically using concepts and ideas from computer science and expressing solutions in a way a computer can understand.

**Computational thinking is NOT programming.**

Computational thinking is used to solve problems in almost every field.

### Pillars of Computational Thinking

- Decomposition
- Pattern recognition
- Abstraction
- Algorithms

#### Decomposition

Break down bigger problems into smaller problems. Then, by finding solutions to the smaller problems, we can solve the bigger problem.

#### Pattern Recognition

Try to see things that are common with similar problems. Find similarities and patterns in the problem. This allows us to reuse solutions.

#### Abstraction

Look at the important parts of the problem and ignore unnecessary things. Look at the overall problem at a higher level and remove extra details. This helps us to simplify the problem.

#### Algorithms

Come up with step-by-step instructions on how to solve the problem.

## Expressing Algorithms with Flowcharts or Pseudocodes

Algorithms can be presented as flowcharts or pseudocodes, specifying each step precisely.
Flowcharts are pictorial representation of algorithms, while pseudocodes are more of high level, textual representations.

Pseudocode is a way of writing a solution to a problem in an informal way, so we remember how we solved the problem and for other people to understand how we solved the problem.  Pseudocode is not a programming language, but we can easily convert pseudocode to programming languages.

## Computer Systems

### History of Computing

#### Abacus

The first known computing device.
- Sumerian Abacus (2700 – 2300 BCE)
- Chinese Abacus (2nd century BCE)

#### Programmable Computer

English mathematician Charles Babbage created,
- Difference Engine (1822)
- Analytical Engine (1834)

This introduced the concept of a programmable computer.

#### Large Scale Electronic Computer

At a high level, software consists of 3 main parts.
- Client
- Server
- Database

### Client

The client is also called the user interface (UI) or the frontend. This is the layer most users will be directly interacting with.

The UI can be developed in different ways.
- Web application – Made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, etc…
- Desktop application – Made with C++, C#, Java, etc…
- Mobile application – Made with Ionic, Swift, Kotlin, etc…

### Server

The server or the backend is the backbone of the system. It is responsible for handling all the requests of the user. Even though the user interacts with the front end, the backend is where all the work happens. The user does not need to know what happens at the backend. Programming languages such as PHP, Ruby, Python, and Go are used to build the backend. This is also known as server-side programming.

### Database

A database can hold various kinds of data including string, integer, float, and images. There are several types of databases. The most commonly used database type is called relational databases. These consists of a set of tables. We call a single row of a table, a record. The backend will access the database and retrieve the relevant information using queries. A query is a command or a request to the database to retrieve a set of data points that satisfies a set of rules. Queries can also be used to update a database. One of the most popular database management systems (DBMS) is MySQL. There are also DBMSs such as PostgreSQL, Cassandra, SQLite, and MongoDB.
