[The Internet](../../../../network/the%20Internet/the%20Internet.md) is commonly used for 3 main purposes. Websites can fall into one or more of these categories.

[The Internet](../../../../network/the%20Internet/the%20Internet.md) and the [WWW](../../../../network/the%20Internet/WWW.md) are not the same thing. [WWW](../../../../network/the%20Internet/WWW.md) is a subset of [the Internet](../../../../network/the%20Internet/the%20Internet.md).

A web address is a type of [URL](../../../../network/the%20Internet/URL.md) that allows us to access content on the [WWW](../../../../network/the%20Internet/WWW.md). It has the following structure.

The Internet Protocol ([IP](../../../../network/communication%20protocol/TCP%20IP%20layer%202/OSI%20layer%203/IP/IP.md)) facilitates communication over [the Internet](../../../../network/the%20Internet/the%20Internet.md). Other protocols such as [HTTP](../../../../network/communication%20protocol/TCP%20IP%20layer%204/OSI%20layer%207/HTTP.md) and [[FTP]] work on top of [IP](../../../../network/communication%20protocol/TCP%20IP%20layer%202/OSI%20layer%203/IP/IP.md).

[The Internet](../../../../network/the%20Internet/the%20Internet.md) uses a client-server model to communicate.

When you make a web request from the web browser, the following happens.

The [DNS](../../../../network/the%20Internet/DNS.md) service is responsible for converting the domain name that you type into an IP address.
