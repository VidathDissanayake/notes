When people are talking about AI/ML, they are typically taking about DL.

# Types of DL

- Convolutional Neural Networks
    - Computer Vision, Image Classifications

- Recurrent Neural Networks
    - Process Sequences, e.g. Text, Speech, Audio

- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
    - Well known in Games, used in Robotics

- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
    - Generating new artificats e.g. photos, videos, music
