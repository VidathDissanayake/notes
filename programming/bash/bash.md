# Bash

> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

Bash, also known as shell, is a scripting language that runs within the terminal on most [Linux](../../OS/linux/Linux.md) distros, as well as macOS.

Bash is an acronym for "*bourne again shell*".

Shell scripts are a sequence of bash commands within a file, combined to achieve more complex tasks than simple one-liner, and are especially useful when it comes to automating sysadmin tasks such as backups.
