Information Security has deep roots in the underground hacking scene. 

The term "hacker" was born in the 1960s in MIT. It refers to people who try to understand how a computer system works, find new ways to use and break them rather than just using it. These people are usually very curious, intelligent, and motivated to pursue knowledge.

Hackers and infosec professionals seek to use computer systems, bypassing restrictions imposed by vendors and programmers to find security any security issues in the system. To perform an attack on a system, you need to have a deep understanding of how it works.

There is always something new to learn in the vast field of information security. Hackers explore and improve their skills daily. Hackers are curious and hungry for knowledge.

Hacking is not only related to computers. It's a lifestyle applied to even [telephone lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Draper) and [people](https://www.mitnicksecurity.com/about/kevin-mitnick-worlds-most-famous-hacker-biography).

[The Conscience of a Hacker](http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html), also known as The Hacker's Manifesto written by The Mentor, gives an idea about the ideals of the underground hacking community. 

Being an infosec professional means pursuing knowledge, being honest and never stop challenging yourself and colleagues.
