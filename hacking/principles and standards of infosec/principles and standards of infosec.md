# Principles and Standards of Information Security

## Principles of Information Security

There are some measures, protocols and frameworks in place that define what makes data secure.

These measures, frameworks and protocols all play a small part in **"Defence in Depth"**.

Defence in Depth is the use of **multiple varied layers of security** to an organisation's systems and data in the hopes that multiple layers will **provide redundancy in an organisation's security perimeter**.

These measures include,
- [CIA triad](CIA%20triad.md)
  - [Bell-La Padula Model][2]
  - [Biba Model][3]
- [Principles of privileges](principles%20of%20privilages.md)
- [Thread Modelling and Incident Response][5]
  - [Threat Modelling][6]
  - [Incident Response][7]
