# History of Cryptography

There are many historic examples of ciphers. However, all of these are easily broken.
- [Substitution Cipher](#Substitution%20Cipher)
- [Caesar Cipher](#Caesar%20Cipher)


## Substitution Cipher

A substitution cipher is a symmetric cipher where each character is mapped to a different character. This mapping is defined in the key called the substitution table.




## Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher is not technically a cipher, as it has no key. Instead, each character is shifted by 3.

So a=d, b=e, c=f, x=a, y=b, z=c and so on.

This is essentially a substitution cipher where the key is fixed.

Therefore, it is easy to find the message if it is known that the encryption is done using Caesar Cipher as the key isn't secret.
