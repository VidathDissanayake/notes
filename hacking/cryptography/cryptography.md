# Cryptography

Cryptography is using mathematical algorithms to encrypt data to protect data.


## Usage

Cryptography is used to protect data. There are many instances of cryptography being used. 

For example:
- [Secure communication](secure%20communication/secure%20communication.md):
    - [web traffic](secure%20communication/web%20traffic.md): [TLS](secure%20communication/protocols/TLS.md)(HTTPS)
    - wireless traffic: 802.11i WPA2(WiFi), GSM(Cell phone), Bluetooth
- Encrypting files on a disk:
    - EFS, TrueCrypt
- Content protection: CSS(DVD), AACS(Blu-ray)
