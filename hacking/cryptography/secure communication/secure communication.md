# Secure Communication

When data is being communicated, cryptography is used to make sure that an attacker can't eavesdrop or tamper with the data being exchanged.

For example, when [web traffic](web%20traffic.md) is being transmitted, SSL/TLS is used to encrypt the insecure HTTP protocol and convert it into the secure HTTPS protocol.
