# SQL Injection (SQLi)

Structured Query Language ([SQL](../../../../programming/sql/SQL.md)) Injection or SQLi is an attack on a web application [database](../../../../programming/sql/database.md) server that causes malicious queries to be executed. When a web application communicates with a [database](../../../../programming/sql/database.md) using input from a user that hasn't been properly validated, there runs the potential of an attacker being able to steal, delete or alter private and customer data and also attack the web applications authentication methods to private or customer areas. This is why as well as SQLi being one of the oldest web application vulnerabilities, it also can be the most damaging.
