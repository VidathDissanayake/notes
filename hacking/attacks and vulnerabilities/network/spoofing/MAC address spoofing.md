# MAC Address Spoofing

An interesting thing with MAC addresses is that they can be faked or "spoofed".

This [spoofing](spoofing.md) occurs when a networked device pretends to identify as another using its [MAC address](../../../../networking/MAC%20address.md).

It can often break poorly implemented security designs that assume that devices talking on a network are trustworthy. 

This can be used to bypass [MAC address](../../../../networking/MAC%20address.md) based access controls and filters.
