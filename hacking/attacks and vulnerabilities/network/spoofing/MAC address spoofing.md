# MAC Address Spoofing

An interesting thing with MAC addresses is that they can be **faked or "spoofed"**.

This [spoofing](spoofing.md) occurs when a networked device **pretends to identify as another** using its MAC address.

It can often break poorly implemented security designs that assume that devices talking on a network are trustworthy. 

This can be used to **bypass MAC address based access controls and filters**.
