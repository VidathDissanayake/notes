# Remote Code Execution (RCE)

A RCE attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, remotely. RCE is one of the most dangerous forms of attack, as it can allow the attacker to gain complete control over the system remotely over the network.

The code executed in the remote machine in this manner is referred to as shellcode.
