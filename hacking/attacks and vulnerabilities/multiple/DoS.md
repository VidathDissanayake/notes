# Denial of Service (DoS)

> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack aims to compromise the [availability](../../principles%20and%20standards%20of%20infosec/CIA%20triad/availability.md) of data, system, or a service. This can be done by making the service crash or by saturating its resources, thus making it unavailable to legitimate users.
