Binary is important because computers represent data in binary format. It is also essential for network addressing and computer logic operations.

Binary notation uses 2 symbols to represent numbers.

- Zero (0)
- One (1)

Computers represent any kind of data with these two symbols. The presence and absence of electricity is used to denote 1 and 0 respectively.

When counting with binary, you start with 0 and increment one. Then you will reach 1, which is the last symbol of binary. Therefore, you need to increment one digit left of it and start back from zero.

$_2$ is placed at the end of the binary number as its base to show that it is a binary number.

E.g:
- $1 + 1 = 10_2$
- $111 + 1 = 1000_2$
