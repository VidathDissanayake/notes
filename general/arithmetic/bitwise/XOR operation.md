XOR performs Logical Exclusive OR between the [bits](../../../network/reference%20models/OSI%20Model/PDU/bit.md) of its operands. If only one of the [bits](../../../network/reference%20models/OSI%20Model/PDU/bit.md) being compared is 1, then the result is 1. If both are 0 or if both are 1, the result is 0. XOR is symbolized by a plus sign inside a circle (⊕).

E.g:

$1001_2$ XOR $1100_2$ = $0101_2$

The truth table of XOR can be represented as follows.

|  A  |  B  | A⊕B |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  0  |  0  |  0  |
|  1  |  0  |  1  |
|  0  |  1  |  1  |
|  1  |  1  |  0  |
