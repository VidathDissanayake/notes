AND performs a Logical AND between the bits of the operands. Which means, if both [bits](../../../network/reference%20models/OSI%20Model/PDU/bit.md) that are being compared are 1, then the result is 1. Otherwise, it's 0. A dot (.) is used to represent the AND operation as it is essentially a multiplication of the two [bits](../../../network/reference%20models/OSI%20Model/PDU/bit.md)

E.g:

$1001_2$ AND $1100_2$ = $1000_2$

The truth table of AND can be represented as follows.

|  A  |  B  | A.B |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  0  |  0  |  0  |
|  1  |  0  |  0  |
|  0  |  1  |  0  |
|  1  |  1  |  0  |
