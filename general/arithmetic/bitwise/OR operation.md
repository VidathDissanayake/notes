OR performs a Logical OR between the [bits](../../../network/reference%20models/OSI%20Model/PDU/bit.md) of the operands. Which means if at least one [bit](../../../network/reference%20models/OSI%20Model/PDU/bit.md) that is being compared is 1, the result is 1. If both [bits](../../../network/reference%20models/OSI%20Model/PDU/bit.md) are 0, then the result is 0. A plus sign (+) is used to represent the OR operation as it is essentially an addition of the [bits](../../../network/reference%20models/OSI%20Model/PDU/bit.md).

E.g:

$1001_2$ OR $1100_2$ = $1101_2$

The truth table of OR can be represented as follows.

|  A  |  B  | A+B |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  0  |  0  |  0  |
|  1  |  0  |  1  |
|  0  |  1  |  1  |
|  1  |  1  |  1  |
