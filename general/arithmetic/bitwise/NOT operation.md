NOT is a simple operation used to flip the [bit](../../../network/reference%20models/OSI%20Model/PDU/bit.md). 0s become 1s and 1s become 0s. NOT works on a single number. The NOT operation is referred to as “bar” and the apostrophe (') is used to represent it.

E.g:

NOT $1101_2$ = $0010_2$

The truth table of the NOT operation can be given as below.

|  A  | A'  |
|:---:|:---:|
