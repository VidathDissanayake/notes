A computer can directly manipulate a [bit](../../../network/reference%20models/OSI%20Model/PDU/bit.md) by using bitwise operations. These are used a lot in network programming and [Assembly](../../../programming/Assembly/Assembly.md) programming.

There are several bitwise operations.
- [OR operation](OR%20operation.md)
- [AND operation](AND%20operation.md)
- [NOT operation](NOT%20operation.md)
- [XOR operation](XOR%20operation.md)
